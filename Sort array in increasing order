    'The reason I'm using While loop,is to simplify the code.When the array element is set to 0 in While array,it remains so until we 
    'make iteration though increase of counting variable (in this case i).Unlike While,For loop will immediately loop throughout all of 
    'its elements.So what we have now,is that we're comparing variable 0 to 1,2,3,4,5,then 1 to 2,3,4,5,then 3 to 4,5,etc.,and each largerst
    'element will replace the smaller one in one counting cyclus.
